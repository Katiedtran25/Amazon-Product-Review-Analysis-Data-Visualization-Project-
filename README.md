Preprocessing
The processing of Web Scraping: query data directly from API to get the dataset in csv.file: 
1. Inspected the XHR network section of the URL to get URL
 2. Input data into Python to create a data format I want
 DATA ANALYSIS METHOD IN PYTHON:
 • Loaded dataset in csv file into Python 
• Used nltk function to stop unnecessary words
 • Performed lemmatization, 
• Extracted sentences to words, 
• Dictionary to look up words and their frequency, 
• Built a topic model, 
• Computed model and coherence score 
• Judged how good the given topic model is,
 • Coherence score: 0.41,

Analyzed Amazon product reviews in physical stores (Wholes Food) II. 
Analyzed Walmart product reviews and online shipping policy III. 
Compared the net sales of both pre and post covid-19 era 
The reviews were picked randomly and the corpus has nearly 1600 reviews of different customers. The dataset was 27 columns including 99% of Amazon product brand and 1% of Moshi. 
Methods / Analysis: 
Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze texts, allowing machines to understand how humans speak.
The results of this Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
Figure 6: Steps to Practice NLP 
• Most popular reviews: blue devices, long-time battery tablets, headphones, sound devices. 
• Positive reviews increased sales by 20% 
• Walmart had bigger net sales than Amazon for everyday basics.
 • Post Covid-19, people love to go to physical stores. 
• Increased the volume of visits in Walmart. 
• Amazon’s sale growth was slowing down.
 Conclusion:
Positive reviews were strongly converting traffic to product listing and increasing traffic that comes from the search engine result page (SERP) on Amazon. Online sales around the world hit $2 trillion per year, a product that had just one review is 65% more likely to be purchased than a product that had none, according to Power Reviews. The impact of reviews was immense in sale revenues. Reviews could be an important part of product listing optimization strategy, not only in converting traffic that came to product listing, but also in increasing or decreasing traffic that came from the search engine result page (SERP).
